# numbers_test

To start the application You just need to complete some little steps
Firstly, since the repository is not private 
I did not add to it my sensitive data such as credentials from Google API
and a Telegram Bot Token

Step 1:

  To get application working You need three files "credentials.json" "token.json" ".env"
  which I add them to .gitignore, You can get theese files from myself, please contact me 
  on telegram "https://t.me/TeamZ_01" to get those files

Step 2:

  After You got all three files place them into main folder "numbers_test" where .gitignore is stored
  If You want to get notification about expired orders delivery time (which was given in the Technical task Part 4.B)
  You have to change the variable value in ".env" file named "TELEGRAM_USER_ID" to Your user_id, You can get Your user_id
  from this telegram bot "https://t.me/getmyid_bot"
  
Step 3:

  When You place all three files correctly open up terminal and type "docker-compose up" and wait for a while
  Then open up Your browser and type "http://0.0.0.0:8000/" to see apliciation working


PS: 

  "I will be glad if You send me any feedback about application. Thank You !"
